# Jon's Untested Last Minute Coleslaw

## Ingredients

* 2 cabbage heads
* 20g salt
* 1/2 cup white vinegar
* 1/8 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon honey dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoons ground tellicherry/peppercorn 

## Slice each cabbage

1) Slice Cabbage lengthwise through core using a chef's knife
2) Slice each cabbage half lengthwise through core.
3) On each of the 4 pieces of cabbage, cut off the core with an angled cut.
4) Thinly slice each piece, then roughly chop all slices (just 2-3 times or so).

## Pickle the cabbage

5) Place sliced cabbage in a large bowl.
6) Add salt, sugar, and 1/4 cup vinegar, then toss to coat.
7) Let sit for at least 10 minutes (max 15 minutes).
8) Completely drain the pickled cabbage. Do not compress the cabbage -- gently drain.

## Add the dressing

9) Whisk 1/4 cup white vinegar, 3/4 cup mayonnaise, and dijon mustard until combined/emulsified to make the dressing.
10) Slowly toss cabbage with the dressing until coated.

## Finish

11) Add ground pepper to taste (probably more pepper than you think (cabbage tends to hides the flavor).
12) Serve immediately (otherwise it'll start to get squishy).
